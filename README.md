# Getting Started with Node.js and MongoDB

This project was bootstrapped with a custom Node.js and MongoDB setup.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the server in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to interact with the backend API.

The server will reload if you make edits (if using `nodemon`).\
You will also see any runtime or syntax errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://mochajs.org/) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Prepares the app for production.\
It transpiles your modern JavaScript (if needed) and organizes the code for deployment.

The final build is optimized for best performance and stability.\
Your backend is now ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/deploying-nodejs/) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the current configuration and setup, you can `eject` at any time. This command will move all config files (e.g., ESLint, Babel, etc.) into your project root so you can fully customize them.

All the commands except `eject` will still work, but now they use your custom setup. At this point, you're responsible for managing everything.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The default setup is good for small to medium backend applications, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. But it’s available when you're ready to scale or customize.
